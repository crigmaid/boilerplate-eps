# Exercises in Programming Style

## Assignments

Each week you will need to implement a program (Term Frequency calculator) in different programming styles.

+ Do **not** use Python
+ Please comment your code
+ Make sure you write an explanation in how to compile (if necessary) and run the program in the *README.md* for each assignment
	+ Providing a bash script or Makefile is encouraged.

## Running the project

We will need to be able to run the project with the following command (assuming we are in the directory of the program, eg, `./week1/`):

`$ ./build.sh && ./run.sh`


There is a chance that for your chosen programming language you will need to modify the build and/or run script. If the language does not need to be compiled you can probably ignore the build script.
